# WeatherApp
Responsive weatherapp built with CSS and HTML

##about 

I created a weatherapp using HTML, CSS and JS. I imported the data I needed using the openweatherAPI. Then rendered it on the page. ranging from temperature to icons and more. 

## Issues

When you access the app for the first time there is an error because storage will be empty, once you run one seatch and refresh the page that error is no longer there as you have
a city in storage

## functionality 

The app is fully responsive on all devices; mobile, tablet and desktop. In addition to this once the UV levels get into the medium and high ranges the colours have a flashing animaiton
